Generative AI and Large Language Models
(LLMs)</h1>
<h1>What is Generative AI?</h2>
<h3>Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence technology that
can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio
and synthetic data. Generative A I relies o n sophisticated machine
learning models called deep learning models—algorithms that simulate the
learning and decision-making processes of the human brain.</h3>
<h3>These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and
relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to
understand users natural language requests or questions and respond with
relevant new content.</h3>
<h3>The technology, it should be noted, is not brand-new. Generative AI was
introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. But it was not until 2014, with the
introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs -- a type of machine
learning algorithm -- that generative A I could create convincingly authentic
images, videos and audio of real people.</h3>
<h3>A I has been a hot technology topic for the past decade, but generative
AI, and specifically the arrival of ChatGPT in 2022, has thrust AI into worldwide
headlines and launched a n unprecedented surge of A I innovation and
adoption. Generative AI offers enormous productivity benefits for individuals
and organizations, and while it also presents very real challenges and risks,
businesses are forging ahead, exploring how the technology can improve their
internal workflows and enrich their products and services. According to
research b y the management consulting firm McKinsey, one third of
organizations are already using generative AI regularly in at least one business
function. Industry analyst Gartner projects more than 80% of organizations will
have deployed generative A I applications or used generative A I application
programming interfaces (APIs) by 2026.</h3>

<h2>How Does Generative AI Work?</h2>
<h3>Generative A I models use neural networks to identify the patterns and
structures within existing data to generate new and original content.
One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to
leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semisupervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to
more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create
foundation models. A s the name suggests, foundation models can be used as
a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks.</h3>
<h3>Examples of foundation models include GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion,
which allow users to leverage the power of language. For example, popular
applications like ChatGPT, which draws from GPT-3, allow users to generate
an essay based o n a short text request. O n the other hand, Stable Diffusion
allows users to generate photorealistic images given a text input.</h3>
<h2>How to Evaluate Generative AI Models?</h2>
<h3>The three key requirements of a successful generative AI model are:</h3>
<h2>1. Quality:</h2> <h3>Especially for applications that interact directly with users,
having high-quality generation outputs is key. For example, in speech
generation, poor speech quality is difficult to understand. Similarly, in
image generation, the desired outputs should b e visually
indistinguishable from natural images.</h3>
<h2>2. Diversity:</h2> A good generative model captures the minority modes in its
data distribution without sacrificing generation quality. This helps reduce
undesired biases in the learned models.
<h2>3. Speed:</h2> Many interactive applications require fast generation, such as
real-time image editing to allow use in content creation workflows.

<h2>How to Develop Evaluate Generative AI Models?</h2>
<h3>There are multiple types of generative models, and combining the
positive attributes of each results in the ability to create even more powerful
models.</h3>
<h2>Diffusion models:</h2> <h3>Also known as denoising diffusion probabilistic
models (DDPMs), diffusion models are generative models that determine
vectors in latent space through a two-step process during training. The
two steps are forward diffusion and reverse diffusion. The forward
diffusion process slowly adds random noise to training data, while the
reverse process reverses the noise to reconstruct the data samples.
Novel data can be generated by running the reverse denoising process
starting from entirely random noise.</h3>

<h3>A diffusion model can take longer to train than a variational autoencoder
(VAE) model, but thanks to this two-step process, hundreds, if not an infinite
amount, of layers can be trained, which means that diffusion models generally
offer the highest-quality output when building generative AI models.</h3>
<h3>Additionally, diffusion models are also categorized as foundation models,
because they are large-scale, offer high-quality outputs, are flexible, and are
considered best for generalized use cases. However, because of the reverse
sampling process, running foundation models is a slow, lengthy process.</h3>
<h3>Learn more about the mathematics of diffusion models in this blog post.</h3>
<h2>Variational autoencoders (VAEs):</h2> <h3>VAEs consist of two neural networks
typically referred to as the encoder and decoder.</h3>
<h3>When given an input, an encoder converts it into a smaller, more dense
representation of the data. This compressed representation preserves
the information that’s needed for a decoder to reconstruct the original
input data, while discarding any irrelevant information. The encoder and
decoder work together to learn an efficient and simple latent data
representation. This allows the user to easily sample new latent
representations that can be mapped through the decoder to generate
novel data.</h3>
<h3>While VAEs can generate outputs such as images faster, the images
generated by them are not as detailed as those of diffusion models.</h3>
<h2> Generative adversarial networks (GANs):</h2> <h3>Discovered in 2014, GANs were
considered to be the most commonly used methodology of the three
before the recent success of diffusion models. GANs pit two neural
networks against each other: a generator that generates new examples
and a discriminator that learns to distinguish the generated content as
either real (from the domain) or fake (generated).</h3>
<h3>The two models are trained together and get smarter as the generator
produces better content and the discriminator gets better at spotting the
generated content. This procedure repeats, pushing both to continually
improve after every iteration until the generated content is indistinguishable
from the existing content.</h3>
<h3>While GANs can provide high-quality samples and generate outputs
quickly, the sample diversity is weak, therefore making GANs better suited for
domain-specific data generation.</h3>
<h3>Another factor in the development of generative models is the
architecture underneath. One of the most popular is the transformer network. It
is important to understand how it works in the context of generative AI.</h3>
<h2>Transformer networks:</h2> <h3>Similar to recurrent neural networks, transformers
are designed to process sequential input data non-sequentially.
Two mechanisms make transformers particularly adept for text-based
generative AI applications: self-attention and positional encodings. Both of
these technologies help represent time and allow for the algorithm to focus on
how words relate to each other over long distances</h3>

<h3>A self-attention layer assigns a weight to each part of an input. The
weight signifies the importance of that input in context to the rest of the input.
Positional encoding is a representation of the order in which input words
occur.</h3>
<h3>A transformer is made up of multiple transformer blocks, also known as
layers. For example, a transformer has self-attention layers, feed-forward
layers, and normalization layers, all working together to decipher and predict
streams of tokenized data, which could include text, protein sequences, or
even patches of images.</h3>

<h2>Usecases of Generative AI?</h2>
<h3>Generative AI models can take inputs such as text, image, audio, video,
and code and generate new content into any of the modalities mentioned. For
example, it can turn text inputs into an image, turn an image into a song, or
turn video into text.</h3>

<h2>What are the benefits of using Generative AI?</h2>
</h3>Beneath the buzz brought upon by ChatGPT and its likes, there are real
benefits of these advanced machine learning models to real-life applications.</h3>

<h2> Improved efficiency:</h2> <h3>Generative A I immediately impacts business
productivity by allowing professionals to perform repetitive tasks quickly.
For example, A I software can help marketers create a marketing plan in
seconds, a process normally taking hours. This way, you can allocate your
resources to other creative or people-intense tasks.</h3>
<h2>Automation-friendly:</h2> <h3>Many businesses are streamlining their workflow to
enable better employee collaboration. Generative A I automation allows
companies to access robust A I capabilities and deploy them on existing
enterprise solutions.</h3>
<h2>Makes informed decisions:</h2> <h3>A t the core of generative A I is a multilayer
neural network capable of processing vast amounts of data. Businesses
can leverage the AI engine to support decision-making b y reducing costly
oversights.</h3>
<h2> Personalized experience:</h2> <h3>Pre-trained generative AI models can be further
fine-tuned with information on your products and services. This lets you
engage customers b y enhancing their journey with automated, relevant,
and personalized responses.</h3>
<h2> Virtual guidance:</h2> <h3>Generative AI opens up the possibility of smart AI
trainers for the public. Businesses can train the model in various
disciplines to help users explore new areas of interest.</h3>
<h2> Content creation & inspiration:</h2> <h3>Language models like GPT are trained
with large numbers of text. They can write poetries, creative stories, and
quotes and perform other tasks to help content creators with imaginative
works.</h3>
<h2>What are the drawbacks of Generative AI?</h2>
<h3> Generative AI consists of large, complex models that are compute-intense
to train and operate. For example, the GPT-4 is believed to have more
than 1 trillion parameters. This makes the model extremely difficult and
expensive to train. Moreover, pre-trained models require further finetuning with human feedback before they are fit for specific use cases.</h3>

<h3> There are legitimate concerns that generative AI applications will replace
the traditional workforce. Companies on a tight budget are already using
AI to fill certain roles. Like all revolutionary technologies, generative AI will
also create new opportunities, but the full implications remain to be seen.</h3>
<h3>· While AI can mimic humans, it might err when producing the output. We
call this phenomenon 'bias', where the AI demonstrates prejudice or
incorrectness from the data it was trained on. For example, an AI credit
scoring system might reject a loan application simply because it does not
have enough data on specific demographics.</h3>


# Result
